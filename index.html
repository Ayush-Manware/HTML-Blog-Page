    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recurion.<br><br>The usual scenario is that you are faced with the number of options,
        and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of
        options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a
        final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't it
        isn't.<br><br>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably have some good leaves and some
        bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad You want to get to a good leaf. At each
        node, begning with the good root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get
        to a leaf.<br><br>Suppose you get a bad leaf. You can backrack to continue the search for a good leaf by
        revoking your most recent choice, in trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of
        options, revoke the choice, that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root
        with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This needs an example:</p>

    <div class="divs">
        <ol>
            <li>Starting at Root, Your options are two A and B. You choose A.</li>
            <li>At A, Your options are C and D. Your choose C.</li>
            <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you already tried C, and it failed you try D.</li>
            <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
            <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
            <li>At B, your options are E and F.Try E.</li>
            <li> E is good Congratulations!</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="note" id="$note">
        <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is the abstract model of the possible sequences of
            choice we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree but usually we dont have a data structure
            to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called
            depth-first tree searching.)</p>

    <h3>The Backtracking Algorithm.</h3>
    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm">
        <pre>
      boolean solve(Node n){
        if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        } else {
            for each child c of n{
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false  
            }
        }
    </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="note" id="$note-2">
        <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding algorithm.
            If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path
            from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that
            includes n to any goal node.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divs">
        <h5>HOW DOES THIS WORK?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
            <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable(part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is
        test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code this,
        is done by the lines</p>
    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-2">
        <pre>
      for each child c of n{
        if solve (c) succeeds,return true
      }
      return false
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out ata leaf node. If the leaf node is the goal node, it is solvable; if
        the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our basecase. In the above code, this is done by
        the lines</p>
    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
        <pre>
          for n is leaf node{
            if the leaf is the goal node, return true
            else return false
          }
          return false

        <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
        <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
            algorithm. In fact that is how, your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
        </p>
        <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
            <pre>
             boolean solve(Node n){
                put node n on the stack;
                  while the stack is not empty{
                    if the node of the top of the stack is a leaf{
                      it is a goal node, return true
                        else it off the stack   
                    }
                     else{
                        if the node at the top of the stack has untried childern
                        push the next untried child onto the track
                       else pop the node of the stack  
                     }
                  }
                  return false
             }
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="divs">
        <p> Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node
            currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence the nodes on the
            stacks of all time describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known
            that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore if the root node gets removed(making the
            stack empty) there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.<br><br>When the
            stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form(in reverse order) a path from the root
            to a goal node.<br><br>Here is the recursive backtrack algorithm, modified slightly to print(in reverse
            order)the nodes along the successfull path:</p>

        <h3>Keep backtracking simple</h3>
        <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem
            they can get pretty c;uttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
        </p>
        <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the
            checkmates and statement solutions.</p>
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, testes like these should be burried in methods. In a chess game, for
            example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <span class="bold">gameOver method</span>(or
            you could even call it <span class="bold">isLeaf</span>). This method could encapsulate all the ugly details
            of figuring out whether any possible move remain.</p>
        <p>Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of
            its children have been tried already(so we dont have to try them again). In the above code we made this code
            simple, by just saying <span class="bold">for each child c of n.</span> In reality, it may be difficult to
            figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess,
            for example, a node can represent one arrangment of pieces on a chessboard, and eac child of node can
            represent the arrangement after some piece have made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how
            would you keep the track pf which ones you have already examined?</p>
        <p>The most straight forward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon
            initial entry of the node(that is when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As
            you try each child take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children and
            you can return"failure". This is a simple approach but may require quite a lot of additional work.</p>
        <p>There is a easier way to keep the track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on
            the children. If there is an ordering and you know which child you tried, you can determine which child to
            try next.</p>
        <p>For example, you might be alble to number the <span class="bold">children 1 through n,</span> and try them in
            a numerical order. Then if you have just tried <span class="bold">child k,</span> you know that you have
            already tried children 1 through <span class="bold">k-1,</span> and you have not yet tried children <span
                class="bold">k+1</span> through <span class="bold">n</span>. Or if you are trying to color a map with
            just four colors, you can aways try <span class="bold"> red first, then yellow, then green, then
                blue.</span> If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you
            can try choices in the order left, straight, right <span class="bold">( or perhaps north, east, west,
                south)</span>.</p>
        <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order a children of a node <span class="bold">In the chess game
                example</span>, you might number your pieces (or perhaps the square of the board) and try them in
            numeric order; but in addition each piece might have several moves, and these must also be ordered. </p>

    <div class="divs">
        <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
        <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We
            will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree</p>
        <p> A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can
            reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred
            to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root
            node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary
            tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first
            example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p>
        <p> Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
        <pre>
        public class BinaryTree {
        BinaryTree leftChild = null; 
             BinaryTree rightChild = null; 
             boolean isGoalNode = false; 
             String name; 
            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) { 
             this.name = name; 
             leftChild = left; 
             rightChild = right; 
             this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode; 
        } 
    }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="divs">
        <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the
            above binary tree.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
        <pre>
            static BinaryTree makeTree() { 
                BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f; 
                c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false); 
                d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false); 
                e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true); 
                f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false); 
                a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false); 
                b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false); 
                root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false); 
                return root; }  
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="divs">
        <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>

        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="divs">
        <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>

            children of a node, without first checking whether those children actually exist.</p>

        <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the
            first thing in solvable. An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if
            they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>

        <h3>What are the children?</h3>
        <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore
            all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as
            far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you
            may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion. <br> <br> Consider, for example, the
            problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how
            convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a
            border are the same color.<br> <br>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color
            for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored. <br><br>There are two ways to do this:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="divs">
        <ul>
            <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether
                you
                are at a goal node.</li>
            <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If
                and
                when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable;
        after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
    <div class="divs">
        <p><strong>booolean maplsOK()</strong></p>
        <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p>
        <p><strong>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</strong></p>
        <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given
            color.</p>
        <p><strong>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</strong></p>
        <p> Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the
            checkerboard).</p>

    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>

                map[row][column] = color; 
                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor = BLUE; 
                nextColor++) { int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);

    <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>

    <h4>Debugging techniques</h4>
    <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</p>
    <div class="divs">
        <h4>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h4>
        <p> Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="divs">
        <h4>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging</h4>
        <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>

                if (node == null) return null; 
                else return node.name; 
            } 
            static void enter(BinaryTree node) { 
                System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 
                indent = indent + "| "; 
            } 
            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { 
                indent = indent.substring(3); 
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");

    <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
        <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { 
                enter(node);

                if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node); 
                if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node); 
                if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node); 
                return no(node);

    <h4>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h4>
    <div class="divs">
        <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?</p>
        <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.</p>
        <p> The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
        <pre>
            static final boolean debugging = false; 



            static void enter(BinaryTree node) { 
                if (debugging) { 
                    System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 
                    indent = indent + "| "; 
                } 
            } 

            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { 
                if (debugging) { 
                    indent = indent.substring(3); 
                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); 
                } 
                return true; 
            } 

            static boolean no(BinaryTree node) { 
                if (debugging) { 
                    indent = indent.substring(3); 
                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false"); 
                } 
                return false; 
            }
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.</p>

        <h4>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h4>
        <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following code</p>
    </div>
    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
        <pre>

            new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print statement.</p>

        <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
        <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach.</p>
        <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p>        <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="divs">
        <p>We write another method <span class="bold">int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</span> that will take a board and a position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."</p>
        <p>Along with <span class="bold"> canMove and makeMove,</span> we are using methods <span class="bold">puzzleSolved and printBoard</span> with meanings that should be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="backtracking-algorithm" id="$backtracking-algorithm-3">
        <pre>
            boolean solvable(int[] board) { 
                if (puzzleSolved(board)) { 
                    return true; 
                } 
                for (int position = 0; 
                position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) { 
                    if (canMove(board, position)) { 
                        int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 
                        if (solvable(newBoard)) { 
                            printBoard(newBoard); 
                            return true; 
                        } 
                    } 
                }
                return false; 
            }
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.</p>
    <p>Here is some output from the program:</p>

<ol reversed class="last-list">
    <li>BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</li>
    <li>BLACK BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE WHITE WHITE</li>
    <li>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE</li>
    <li>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE</li>
    <li>BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
    <li>BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
    <li>_____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
    <li>WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
    <li>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE</li>
    <li>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____</li>
    <li>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK</li>
    <li>WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
    <li>WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
    <li>WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
    <li>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</li>
    <li>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
</ol>
    <div class="note">
        <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct order.</p>
